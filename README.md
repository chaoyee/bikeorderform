BikeOrderForm
=======

BikeOrderFrom is a site which demos the major functionality from an on-line ordering page of a bike website.

It consists of an ordering from for choosing models as well as color and size accrodingly.

The color and size attributes are different from model to model.  For example, model A might have blue, red and yellow in colors, model B might have blue only. There is no rule for assigning colors and size to each model. This system builds up a form to setup the color and size configurations for each model. Thus, users can find the correct color abd size to choose for a certain model.

This demo site utilizes techniques as follows:

- Bootstrap style
- jQuery Ajax (<http://charles4code.blogspot.tw/2016/08/using-jquery-ajax-in-rails-appliccations.html>)
- commonly used flash message bar in Rails (<http://charles4code.blogspot.tw/2016/09/make-standard-flash-message-bar-with.html>)
- collection_check_boxes (<http://charles4code.blogspot.tw/2016/08/using-collectioncheckboxes-to-simplify.html>)
